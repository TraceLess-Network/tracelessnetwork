# TraceLess Network Whitepaper (Draft)

### Abstract
TraceLess Network (TRL) introduces the **Trusted Relay Layer** —  
a privacy-preserving framework that enables untraceable and decentralized transactions.

### Core Idea
TRL acts as an invisible bridge between blockchain networks,  
ensuring total anonymity while maintaining transaction integrity and scalability.

### Goals
1. Zero-trace transaction relay
2. Multi-layer encryption
3. Interoperable privacy between chains
4. Developer-friendly SDK
