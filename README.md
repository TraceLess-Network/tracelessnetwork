# TraceLess Network (TRL)

> **Privacy Reimagined. Beyond the Chain.**

TraceLess Network is creating the **Trusted Relay Layer (TRL)** —  
a universal privacy infrastructure for the next generation of decentralized systems.

In a world where every transaction is watched, TraceLess brings **freedom, security, and invisibility** back to the blockchain.  
Built for scalability, interoperability, and trustless privacy — TRL is where the chain ends and **true anonymity begins**.

### 🧠 The Trusted Relay Layer (TRL)
A new foundation for Web3 privacy — combining:
- **Zero-Trace Transactions** – every transfer is unlinkable and invisible.  
- **Adaptive Encryption** – multi-layer protection across nodes.  
- **Cross-Network Compatibility** – seamlessly bridges EVM & non-EVM chains.

### 💡 Our Vision
To build a **borderless privacy layer** —  
a network where users control their identity, data, and destiny.  
Privacy is not a luxury. It’s the default.
