# TraceLess Network (TRL)

> **Privacy Reimagined. Beyond the Chain.**

TraceLess Network is creating the **Trusted Relay Layer (TRL)** —  
a universal privacy infrastructure for the next generation of decentralized systems.

In a world where every transaction is watched, TraceLess brings **freedom, security, and invisibility** back to the blockchain.  
Built for scalability, interoperability, and trustless privacy — TRL is where the chain ends and **true anonymity begins**.

###  The Trusted Relay Layer (TRL)
A new foundation for Web3 privacy — combining:
- **Zero-Trace Transactions** – every transfer is unlinkable and invisible.  
- **Adaptive Encryption** – multi-layer protection across nodes.  
- **Cross-Network Compatibility** – seamlessly bridges EVM & non-EVM chains.  

---

###  Our Vision
To build a **borderless privacy layer** —  
a network where users control their identity, data, and destiny.  
Privacy is not a luxury. It’s the default.

---

###  Development Scope
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **TRL Core** | The backbone relay protocol enabling zero-trace communication. |
| **TRL Wallet** | Private, secure wallet for anonymous asset transfers. |
| **TRL SDK** | Developer toolkit for integrating TRL privacy into dApps. |

---

###  The Movement
TraceLess Network is not just technology — it’s a shift in digital freedom.  
We are redefining how privacy is built, shared, and trusted.
